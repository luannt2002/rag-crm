"""Mega-sprint G22 — drop dead LangGraph node registrations.

Background. ``build_graph`` historically registered nodes ``check_cache``
and ``rewrite`` directly on the StateGraph, then the parallel-wrapper
refactor introduced ``cache_check_and_understand_parallel`` and
``rewrite_and_mq_parallel`` as the actual node targets every conditional
edge routes to. The two original registrations became orphans — no
``add_edge`` and no conditional-route value targets the names
``check_cache`` or ``rewrite`` as graph nodes (the strings appear as
*decision keys* in conditional-edge dicts but the values map to the
parallel wrappers).

The closures themselves are still live: the parallel wrappers call them
when their config flag is OFF (byte-identical fallback). Only the
``add_node`` registrations are dead — removing them slims the compiled
graph and removes a foot-gun for future maintainers who might wire a new
edge to the orphan name.

``condense_question`` and ``router`` look superficially similar but are
genuinely reachable: ``_cache_route`` returns ``"condense_question"`` →
maps to the ``condense_question`` node when ``merge_condense_router`` is
False (legacy non-merged path), and ``condense_question`` then
``add_edge``s to ``router``. We MUST keep those two registrations.
